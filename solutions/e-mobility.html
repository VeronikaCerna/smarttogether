    <p>The ultimate goal of all mobility related activities within SMARTER TOGETHER is to reduce the use of gas-operated, conventional cars to achieve a better carbon footprint, less pollution and noise emissions.</p>
    <p>The two pillars that will be demonstrated in the project are the provision of sustainable e-mobility solutions implemented and deployed by citizen and centered access strategies to mobility solutions in terms of ICT infrastructure mobility facilities.</p>
    <p>In order to bring e-mobility solutions to a successful, long term operation, different business and operational models dedicated to the according application and user needs will be deployed.</p>
    <p>At a private level sharing is a smart way of using e-mobility where novel business models like the service integration to the offer of housing companies will be demonstrated. Of course, sharing as well as e-car pooling will also be utilized for business solutions.</p>
    <p>For the logistic domain the need for the electrification of their fleets due to specific requirements will be demonstrated. These activities are enriched by novel solutions using other e-vehicles like e-bikes, pedelecs and even e-forklifts.</p>
