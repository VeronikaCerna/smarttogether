Citizen and stakeholder engagement is a core part of the SMARTER TOGETHER project with regards to collaborative adaption of foreseen measures during the implementation phase. Mobile as well as residential hubs for citizen engagement placed within the three cities will bundle the communication.

The main targets are to disseminate information, organize outreach activities and gather opinions for the optimization of technical measures, the reduction of CO2 emissions and securing quality of life in the targeted areas.

### Measures will be implemented on three different levels:

*   Integration of existing activities (management of stakeholders and interventions) in the lighthouse areas
*   Development of platforms for outreach, information and communication with the public to address a variety of local stakeholders and attract high public attention
*   Concept and delivery of series of collaborative processes with relevant stakeholders: businesses, providers of solutions, knowledge holders, citizens, other interested parties
