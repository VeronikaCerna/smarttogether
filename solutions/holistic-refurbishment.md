The three lighthouse cities will develop a first-of-its-kind low energy district through a holistic approach which connects building, energy management system and mobility. This has never been done before at this scale and with the type of buildings targeted in the project. The demonstration areas follow ambitious energy standards well beyond the legal requirements for refurbishment projects in France, Germany and Austria.

Each lighthouse city aims to minimize by 60% on average the energy consumption of buildings by deep refurbishment of existing building stock composed of mainly of multi-apartment buildings owned by one single housing association but also jointly owned apartment buildings.

### The solutions of this cluster that will be deployed will be among others:

*   Outside thermal insulation material or opaque building envelopes
*   High efficiency windows
*   Hybrid or heat recovery ventilation system
*   Use of waste heat for hot water generation
*   Energy-efficient lighting systems
*   Cross cutting ICT-solutions for sustainable energy use and convenience
*   Smart home solutions
*   Intelligent heating control system
*   Energy storage
*   Home Energy Management.

### The refurbishment activities will be carried out in different ownership constellations and include smart and cost effective refurbishment:

*   for shared ownership buildings
*   for public and social housing buildings
*   for privately owned building
*   for public buildings and garages.

It is very difficult to trigger refurbishment activities in buildings that are in the shared ownership of homeowner associations. Therefore, in Lyon and Munich specific awareness campaign will be implemented and the technical and financial support of owners will be sought to trigger refurbishment. The positive transformation of the areas and the construction of new ambitious buildings are expected to be factors that can push owners to undertake the refurbishment of existing buildings.
