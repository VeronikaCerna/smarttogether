The ultimate goal of all mobility related activities within SMARTER TOGETHER is to reduce the use of gas-operated, conventional cars to achieve a better carbon footprint, less pollution and noise emissions.

The two pillars that will be demonstrated in the project are the provision of sustainable e-mobility solutions implemented and deployed by citizen and centered access strategies to mobility solutions in terms of ICT infrastructure mobility facilities.

In order to bring e-mobility solutions to a successful, long term operation, different business and operational models dedicated to the according application and user needs will be deployed.

At a private level sharing is a smart way of using e-mobility where novel business models like the service integration to the offer of housing companies will be demonstrated. Of course, sharing as well as e-car pooling will also be utilized for business solutions.

For the logistic domain the need for the electrification of their fleets due to specific requirements will be demonstrated. These activities are enriched by novel solutions using other e-vehicles like e-bikes, pedelecs and even e-forklifts.
