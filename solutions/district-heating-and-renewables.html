    <p>The three lighthouse cities have similar approach to maximising the use of local energy resources including renewable heat and power. They all operate a district heating network to deliver renewable energy sources (RES) heat to the buildings of the district.</p>
    <p>The share of RES in the heat supply will come from four different primary sources - wood in Lyon, geothermal energy in Munich, solar-thermal energy and waste heat in Vienna. All three of them control the distribution of heat in the district with local operators: SPL Lyon Confluence in Lyon, Stadtwerke MÃ¼nchen (SWM) in Munich, Wien Energie in Vienna.</p>
    <p>The solutions of this cluster also include photovoltaic (PV) systems that will be deployed in Vienna and in Lyon with a focus on smart PV inverters with power control features and storage in order to lower the impacts of systems onto the local distribution grid.</p>
