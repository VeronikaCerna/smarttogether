Smart Data is the evolutionary step for big data adding the aspects of value, semantics, data quality, security and privacy protection. Through the integration of different data silos or data views - energy, transport, crowd-data - a holistic view of the information will be created in the form of a smart data platform. This will provide a basis for the development of innovative smart city services.

The platform will enable and stimulate a proper understanding of how infrastructure is used in different domains, the interdependencies between different elements of infrastructure and the effects of external drivers such as public policy, major events and weather patterns and precipitation. The measure will follow an open data and open platform approach with the aim of generating an ecosystem of development partners. It will also strengthen network effects and encourage the participation and engagement of citizens.

The core concept of open smart data platforms will be fully implemented in Lyon and Munich with their respective solutions. In addition, Lyon will develop a systematic data exchange between the grid operator and the local community by providing an hourly consumption data per plot. Due to local legal conditions and constraints, Vienna will pave the way to the development of such data platform with regards to legal requirements as well as stakeholder learning and motivation with the aim of developing sustainable participatory solutions.

The data platforms deployed in SMARTER TOGETHER are controlled by local public bodies and there will be no commercial use of personal data, the collected data will be used only for the purposes of the project.
