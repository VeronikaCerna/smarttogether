The three lighthouse cities have similar approach to maximising the use of local energy resources including renewable heat and power. They all operate a district heating network to deliver renewable energy sources (RES) heat to the buildings of the district.

The share of RES in the heat supply will come from four different primary sources - wood in Lyon, geothermal energy in Munich, solar-thermal energy and waste heat in Vienna. All three of them control the distribution of heat in the district with local operators: SPL Lyon Confluence in Lyon, Stadtwerke MÃ¼nchen (SWM) in Munich, Wien Energie in Vienna.

The solutions of this cluster also include photovoltaic (PV) systems that will be deployed in Vienna and in Lyon with a focus on smart PV inverters with power control features and storage in order to lower the impacts of systems onto the local distribution grid.
