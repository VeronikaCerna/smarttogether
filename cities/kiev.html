    <p>Kiev, capital and largest city of Ukraine with 2,9 million inhabitants, is an important industrial, scientific, educational, and cultural centre in Eastern Europe. The city has an extensive infrastructure and highly developed system of public transport, including the Kiev Metro. Munich, Sofia and Vienna are twin cities of Kiev and share experiences in many different partnerships, e.g. in exchange with Munich NGOs and experts of the administration developed concepts to increase energy efficiency and sustainable mobility. Despite difficulties, Kiev considers implementing measures, which ensure that results and outcomes of the lighthouse cities will be replicated, supported by political and strategic concepts at city level.</p>
