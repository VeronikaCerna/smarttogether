    <p>Yokohama, with a population of 3.7 million, is the second largest city in Japan after Tokyo and Lyonâ€™s twin city. Yokohama is one of four cities involved in the Japan Smart City project coordinated by New Energy Promotion Council from Japan. The Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) is an effort to develop a model for smart cities by means of cooperation between citizens, private companies, and the municipality, and to export the successful model to Japan and the rest of the world. It involves 4.000 households, four office buildings, three commercial buildings and one large-scale factory.</p>
