Lyon's demonstration area is Lyon Confluence - one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in France (150 ha – 600 000 m2 existing floor area – 1.000.000 m2 of new buildings).  It is the first WWF approved urban development in France and it is the largest urban redevelopment area in France with such an ambitious target such as the zero carbon objectives.

### Lyon strives to:

* refurbish existing buildings (35,000 m2.) and build wood-gas fired cogeneration power plant
* provide alternative means of transport for inhabitants: smart charging stands and electric-vehicle car-sharing system
* involve citizens in the redevelopment of the Lyon Confluence area
* increase the quality of life of inhabitants through construction of comfortable and affordable dwellings and office places, convenient public spaces, easy access to the district, etc.
