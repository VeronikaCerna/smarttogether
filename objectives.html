    <h3>We are SMARTER TOGETHER</h3>
    <p>The European lighthouse cities Vienna, Munich and Lyon, the follower cities Santiago de Compostela, Sofia and Venice, the observer cities Kiev and Yokohama come together to improve citizens’ quality of life. SMARTER TOGETHER will prepare the ground for large-scale replication and ensure an in-depth knowledge transfer about setting up of smart city business models and user-centric innovation in order to contribute to positive societal dynamics.</p>

    <h3>We strive to:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Successfully implement <strong>LARGE SCALE DEMONSTRATION</strong> in various urban and governance conditions of the three cities.</li>
      <li>Successfully implement new <strong>SMART CITY BUSINESS MODELS</strong> able to provide lifecycle-oriented operation and to foster job creation and business acceleration on a local level.</li>
      <li>Respect the <strong>URBAN FABRIC</strong> of the cities by addressing  the needs of various urban typologies and environments to ensure a large scale replication.</li>
      <li>To achieve <strong>USER-CENTRIC INNOVATION</strong> by fully associating all stakeholders thanks to the SMARTER TOGETHER living lab for citizen engagement approach, which relies on local ecosystems, user experience and citizens’ association throughout the process designed as responsible partnership.</li>
      <li>Develop a holistic <strong>LOW ENERGY DISTRICT APPROACH</strong> for sustainable LED combining (1) the fully refurbishment of existing blocks of buildings (up to 146. 0000 m² targeted), with different layouts and sizes, different types of ownership (public/private/joint ownership), and (2) the integration of a whole RES portfolio including storage waste heat solutions.</li>
      <li>Develop several <strong>NEXT GENERATION DISTRICT HEATING</strong> systems as solutions for smart city districts which are more flexible and reliable, capable of integrating RES to a maximum and implement successfully news business models for heating provision.</li>
      <li>Develop <strong>SMART DATA MANAGEMENT PLATFORMS</strong> and smart services for integrated infrastructures, a connected first of its kind district fully monitoring the energy flows and increasing the efficiency of the energy management system.</li>
      <li>Develop electrical vehicles and integrate them through <strong>E-MOBILITY SOLUTIONS</strong> in the public network and in the energy management system of the districts</li>
    </ul>
